Description: # ddb
         A sql interface for flat files written in python 
        
        
        ## Install
        ```
        pip install ddb
        # OR
        pipenv install ddb
        ```
        
        ### Commandline interface
        ```
        ddb
        # OR
        ddb --config-dir --query 'select * from `tablename` where column=value limit 0,10'
        ```
        
        ### Code integration
        ```
        import ddb
        
        e=ddb.engine('config_dir')
        
        results=e.query('select * from `tablename` where column=value limit 0,10')
        
        
        ```
        
        
        ### Query support
        - Query support is limited. As needed I'll improve the system.
        - If you're doing vastly comlicated things, it shouldn't be with a flat file.
        - This code is slow. It will be refactored, but not until more support is added.
        
        
        ### Supported Querys
        - SELECT [COLUMNS] FROM [Table] [WHERE] [ORDER BY] [LIMIT]
        - INSERT INTO [TABLE] ([COLUMNS]) VALUES ([VALUES])
        - DELETE FROM [TABLE] [WHERE] 
        - UPDATE [TABLE] SET [[COLUMN=VALUE]] [WHERE]
        - SHOW COLUMNS
        - SHOW TABLES
        
        ### Not supported
        - Right now this is a POC, complex operations are not supported, but are in the works.
        - JOIN, COUNT, SUM, DISTINCT, GROUP BY are all high on the list
        
        ### TODO
        - curses browser for results
        - unit testing
        
        ### Examples
        
        # SELECT
        # UPDATE
        # INSERT
        # DELETE
        # CONFIG
        ```
        ```
