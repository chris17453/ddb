# ddb (delimited database)

 A serviceless sql interface for flat files written in python


## What does it do?
- ddb sits on top of text files, giving them a database access layer
- you can read, write, update csv's or any type of delimited text file via sql


## What are the human benifits to using ddb?
- a common interface for all of your flat files
- multiple points of integration (progromatic and cli)
- sql is easy to work with, no coding required
- the text file stays the same
- wont break or affect anything that might use the file


## What are the technical benifits to using ddb?
- it does not run as a service, nothing to maintain
- it can run on any server with python 2.7>
- low memory foot print. it reads data 1 line at a time
- eases the effort of data migration using sql
- the text file does not change
- accessibility of the text file doesnt change
- ease of automation
- error handeling for bad data
- event logging
- no caching at all, all access is live
- optimized for speed using cython


## How do I use it?
- with python [python integration](docs/python-integration.md)
- from bash [cli](docs/cli.md)
